intro: |
  In the digital symphony, I wore the hat of a maestro in CRM development for sales funnels, composed custom LMS solutions, choreographed data pipelines for product pricing prophecies, and orchestrated Docker/Kubernetes parties on Nvidia's hardware dance floor. 
  
  As the cybersecurity jester, I added a touch of humor to the serious business of safeguarding data, all while moonlighting as the trusted associate to our esteemed Data Scientists. 
  
  It wasn't just a job; it was a data-driven carnival, and I was the ringleader of this computational circus. ðŸŽ©ðŸš€ðŸ’»

          The design system was set out with rules to ensure the icons
          could be used in a wide range of circumstances â€” like for different
          cultures, at small sizes and with and without labels.

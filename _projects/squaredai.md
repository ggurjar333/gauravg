  The [Public Utility Data Liberation Project](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl) provides analysis-ready energy system data to climate advocates, researchers, policymakers, and journalists.

  It takes the original spreadsheets, CSV files, and databases and turns them into a unified resource. This enables users to spend more time on novel analysis and less time on data preparation. 

  I am contributing to Bash scripting right now.
